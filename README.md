# FACE-DETECTION-USING-OpenCV
A ML Model that detects human faces in camera video stream.


In this modern world as machine learning is becoming a part of our life, nothing can escape its influence. The most simple example of machine learning is in your pocket. Yes Right! Your mobile. The virtual assistant (Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri) are the best example of ML. Even the World famous face detection lock of apple is ML.

Face detection is used almost everywhere let it be Autonomous Driving (famous Tesla cars) or face detection software on your mobile. In this project I have implemented  a simple CNN model to detect human faces.


# HOW TO DO IT?
Here we are using OpenCV to detects face using Haar Cascade Classifier.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
